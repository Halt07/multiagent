Eat apples and watch your snake grow as you race your opponent, leaving stone obstacles along the way.
iA Golden Apple will periodically appear for a limited time, when eaten it will give a very slight speed boost as it increases your score by 2 instead of 1, be wary of the speed boost, and avoid the walls, the opponent's snake, stone walls created by shedding skin, and your own snake as you collect as many apples as you can!
