I thought that I got my whole microphone thing figured out, as you see in the video at the beginning it was registering that I was talking, but it will not save the audio to the output file....

So long story short, my roomba will move randomly when it encounters an obstacle, moving or non-moving. It will also move randomly when it senses dirt. I found that it took a long time for a single roomba to clean the room, however, it was much more efficient when there were many obstacles and an irregular shape to the room. I had 3 different types of dirt piles, light, medium, and heavy. When the heavy was passed over once it became a medium pile, and a medium became a light pile, and so on.

When I added more roombas, such as the swarm of 10 that I have shown in my video, I found that they were incredibly efficient and cleaned the room in about 4 minutes on average. I believe this to be because of the reactive nature of the roomba. When it had more obstacles(or roombas) it had more things that would force it away from the outer walls of the room and into the other spaces that it had not previously visited. I also found it interesting that usually the randomly placed dirt was actually mostly cleaned up in the first 30 seconds to a minute. Then it would take the other 3 minutes to finally get at that last one or two piles. So about 95% of the cells were visited within 1 minute, which I feel was pretty effective. Even with only 1 roomba, about 80% of the cells were visited within 5 minutes.

My roombas were also programmed so that when they ran out of charge they would go to their stations(their initial starting space, randomly generated at the beginning) to recharge. This was indicated by the gray square that appeared on their back.
